		<div>OK everyone, shuffle into line. Line up for getting into the school. Line up to go for recess. Line up for the sake of lining up.
Order is nice.
</div>
		<div>GO TO HIGH SCHOOL</div>
		<div>Primary School
</div>
		<div>High School
</div>
		<div>High school is full of new things. New people, new responsibility, a new way of being. This is where you start the rest of your life. Right now, you can be anything you want to be. Which means making a decision.

Good thing it’s so simple.</div>
		<div>GO TO UNIVERSITY</div>
		<div>BECOME A STREET BUM

		<div>DESIGN STUDIES
</div>
		<div>GYM
</div>
		<div>DRAMA
</div>
		<div>PHYSICS
</div>
		<div>BAND
</div>
		<div>Wait a minute. A choice? High school brings your first opportunity to choose what you want to do. Foods or Math? These are the big life decisions of today.
Let’s just pick a few and get on with it.
</div>
		<div>CHEMISTRY
</div>
		<div>BIOLOGY
</div>
		<div>What do you want to take?
</div>
		<div>FOODS
</div>
		<div>make a decision in</div>
		<div>I’ll probably be a doctor or something.

		<div>High school is full of new things. New people, new responsibility, a new way of being. This is where you start the rest of your life. Right now, you can be anything you want to be. Which means making a decision.


Good things it’s so simple...
</div>
		<div>I’ll probably be a teacher or something.
</div>
		<div>UNIVERSITY
</div>
		<div>MAKE A CHANGE
</div>
		<div>ASSESS
</div>
		<div>Something happens during this time. When it gets a little more ‘real’ you tend to think critically about if what you are doing is something you want to do for the rest of your life.

Right now the most important decision is: Are you happy?
</div>
		<div>I’M HAPPY
</div>
		<div>What do you want to do instead?
</div>
		<div>TRY THIS OUT
</div>
		<div>That’s the beauty of this. If you don’t like your situation, you can make a change.


Instead I want to:
</div>
		<div>bachelor of design
</div>
		<div>GRADUATE
</div>
		<div>GIVE UP
</div>
		<div>Not really a decision time now. Time to put your head down
and finish school. Just make sure all your hens are in a row.
A nice calm before the storm of the real world.
</div>
		<div>GRADUATION
</div>
		<div>pass all my classes
</div>
		<div>Graduate in</div>
		<div>personal website

		<div>JOB 4
</div>
		<div>After graduation your life begins. You have explored a field that you had interest and passion for, and now is the time to become someone in that field, and contribute to something. 

You now have to decide what you want to do.

What area do you want a job in?
</div>
		<div>mentorship
</div>
		<div>JOB 1
</div>
		<div>Define “doing interesting things"
</div>
		<div>JOB 5

		<div>A JOB
</div>
		<div>JOB 3
</div>
		<div>collaborating with a team
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>work
</div>
		<div>You’ve found something that interests you. That engages you.
Now is the time to gain experience. Both in technical skills as well as the understanding of what you want to do, where you want to go from there.

Take some time enjoying this. Work somewhere that you think will be interesting for you. Then assess your situation again. 


</div>
		<div>Experience, Then Assess
</div>
		<div>Assess in</div>
		<div>INDUSTRIAL DESIGN
</div>
		<div>Beginning design school is the largest decision you’ve made to this point, and within it comes many more choices. What kind of designer do you want to be? What kind of career do you want to have? What kind of person do you want to be? Apparently there is only two options...
</div>
		<div>DESIGN SCHOOL
</div>
		<div>VISUAL COMMUNICATION DESIGN
</div>
		<div>Begins in</div>
		<div>CREATIVE WRITING
</div>
		<div>BROCHURE DESIGNER

		<div>APP DESIGN

		<div>DESIGN MANAGEMENT
</div>
		<div>SOCIAL CHANGE
</div>
		<div>MEANINGFUL
</div>
		<div>CRITICAL DESIGN
</div>
		<div>INTERACTIVE MEDIA
</div>
		<div>Ah, and we see the big decisions now that we were hoping for. What do most of these even mean? How do you know what you are going to like?

Well you’ll never know if you don’t try. Pick a bunch. 
</div>
		<div>MARKETING
</div>
		<div>ILLUSTRATION
</div>
		<div>VIDEO GAME
</div>
		<div>PHOTOGRAPHY
</div>
		<div>WEB DESIGN
</div>
		<div>SCULPTURE
</div>
		<div>PAINTING
</div>
		<div>BIG PICTURE
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Assess
</div>
		<div>You’ve found something that interests you. That engages you.
Now is the time to gain experience. Both in technical skills as well as the understanding of what you want to do, where you want to go from there.

Take some time enjoying this. Work somewhere that you think will be interesting for you. Then assess your situation again. 

Nothing is stuck like that forever. Follow what drives you and you will be happy. At least that’s what dad always says. 

But make sure you enjoy the journey. Happiness isn’t something you should chase. Happiness is something that you should carry with you while you follow what you are passionate about. Dad always had these weird sayings.


</div>
		<div>Happiness

		<div>Happiness in</div>
